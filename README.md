Hello. This is a timed screen-capture app.  It's meant to help enable parents to monitor what their children are seeing on the internet.  It stores screenshots which can be retrieved later.

After creating an account, you set a time delay 
for automatically taking screenshots and you can start using it.

A screenshot will be taken and converted to a text file.  The file will be encrypted,
and it will be saved into a database to add to the security of the information stored.
Only a signed in user can access their screenshots.

Windows OS currently.
