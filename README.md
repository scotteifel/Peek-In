Welcome. This is a timed screen-capture app.  It's mainly meant to help enable parents to monitor what their children are seeing on the internet, but it can be used for other cases as well.  It stores screenshots which can be retrieved later.

After creating an account, set a time delay 
for automatically taking screenshots and you can start using it.

A screenshot will be taken and converted to a text file.  The file will be encrypted,
and it will be saved into a database to add to the security of the information stored.
Only a signed in user can access their screenshots.

For Windows OS only currently.

Just a few points about the app.

It will boot up and run, but there are some bugs to fix.

Closing the window
  - If a window is hidden, by clicking the "Hide Window" button, it must be stopped
  in the terminal.  The same situation happens with clicking the X to close the
  window.  If the "Exit Program" button is pressed, it will turn off the
  screenshot algorithm.  This behavior is to allow the app to run in the background.

Viewing Images
  - Images can be viewed by pressing the "View Images" button.  They will 
  persist until deleted.

Setting the timer
  - To change the time between screenshots, press the "Settings" button
  and configure it there.
