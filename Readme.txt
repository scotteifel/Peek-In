Just a few points about the app.

It will boot up and run, but there are some bugs to fix.

* Closing the window
    If a window is hidden, by clicking the "Hide Window" button, it must be stopped in the terminal.  The same situation happens with clicking the X to close the window.  If the "Exit Program" button is pressed, it will turn off the screenshot algorithm.  This behavior is to allow the app to run in the background.

 *Viewing Images
    Images can be viewed by pressing the "View Images" button.  They will persist until deleted.

* Setting the timer
    To change the time between screenshots, press the "Settings" button and configure it there.
