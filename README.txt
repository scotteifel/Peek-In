Peek-In

![Home Window](assets/PeekInMainWindow.png?raw=true)

Hello and welcome. This is a device monitoring app.  It could be useful for parents who want to monitor what is on
the computer screen.  It stores screenshots which can be retrieved later.  It also has a way to run
in the background, so it is not easily detectable.

This uses the Tkinter and TTkinter (for a better UI) packages.

To use:
   Clone the project, install the dependencies, and run the program by typing gui.py in a terminal.

   After creating an account, you set a time delay 
   for automatically taking screenshots and you can start using it.

   A screenshot will be taken and converted to a text file.  The file will be encrypted,
   and it will be saved into a database to add to the security of the information stored.
   Only a signed in user can access their screenshots.

This could be turned into an executable program.

This is developed for the Windows OS currently.
